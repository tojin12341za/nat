As an Internet gateway, public IP addresses are required to make NAT Gateway fucntion normally. You can bind an Elastic IP Address \(EIP\) to a NAT Gateway as a public IP to use.

**Note:**  If your account has a purchased NAT bandwidth package before January 26, 2018, you still need to use the bandwidth package to provide public IPs. Open a ticket if you want to bind an EIP to NAT Gateway.
